# TinyULL

TinyULL is an URL shortener written to be used at University of La Laguna by Eduardo Nacimiento.
  - Accepts urls from one domain. For example: ```(*.)ull.es(/*)```
  - Generates a short url from a single url or from a full text with urls inside.

TinyULL is developed in PHP and Mysql, the previous version was made with Ruby On Rails and you can see it in the old branch.
